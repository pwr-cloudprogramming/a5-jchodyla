## Reflections

- What did you learn?
*I learned how to deploy AWS EC2 instance with my application using Terraform*
- What obstacles did you overcome?
*I did overcome problems with accessing my github repository using ssh by changes in main.tf file and setting my repository as public. I also overcome problem with obtaining the IP of my instance and passing it to the frontend by changes in main.tf file.* 
- What did you help most in overcoming obstacles?
*Stackoverflow, YouTube tutorials and Mr. Thomas*
- Was that something that surprised you?
*How quickly my AWS account budget is getting used up*
